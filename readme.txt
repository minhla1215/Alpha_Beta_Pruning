Project Name: Alpha Beta Pruning

1. Brief description:
This project is made for USC AI 460. This program uses the alpha beta pruning algorithm utilizing Min and Max. The program is a recursive function finds the max or min of the children nodes so maximize the best path to take.
The program also looks at the children of the node and see if they could improve the solution at all. If they do not, the node and their children are skipped. This would make the algorithm much faster.

Results contain:
Expanding min/max node <name>: alpha= ?  beta == ?
Expanding min/max node <name>: alpha= ?  beta == ?
Expanding min/max node <name>: alpha= ?  beta == ?
Skipping expansion of Node <name> because it cannot make beta lower

     
Value of Max Node A = ?

Move that Max Node A would make is = <name>
